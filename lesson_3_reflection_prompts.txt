When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So you can access the work from anywhere. Such as having a work project, so the work is accessed from the office. 
    But also having the option to work from home occasionally, so the project can still be accessed from home. Also, 
    remote projects and telecommuting is becoming quite popular, so it is neccessary to be able to have a remote 
    repository for everyone on the project to have access to. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If git was automatically pull changes, we might overwrite a version that we didn't mean to or end up with more versions that we want. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are a way to clone from another author's work, while still giving them credit - it only works on GitHub - from account to account. After forking, the forked repository can be cloned to a local directory. A branch is used sort of like creating another version, perhaps it will be experimental, but still keeping the original intact.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Makes collaboration easier if working on a multiple member team. Especially if there will be some period of time without access to the remote.
